# MyTrend Backend

Welcome to the MyTrends app! This app allows the user to add and view the newest fashion trends, while also curating their top looks in their favorite page. Each item will include a name, price, description, category and image. From the trends page, you can add a look to your favorites, remove from favorites, or delete completely. The app also has additional functionality that enlarges the image when a mouse hovers over the image.
